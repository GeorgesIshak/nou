    description: `Designed for a family of five with a passion for contemporary art, GY House is a bespoke residence that balances the needs of everyday family life with the elegance of a curated gallery space. 
At the heart of the home is a dramatic entrance, conceived to showcase a suspended sculptural artwork by a renowned Cypriot artist—a powerful introduction to the clients’ extensive art collection. 
Responding to the client's two primary requests—privacy and generous ceiling heights—the architecture is shaped like a modern fortress: solid and introverted, with blind perimeter walls that shield the interior from view. Above, the first-floor volume appears to float, visually detached from the base by a ribbon of horizontal windows that filter light into the ground floor, creating moments of illumination and intrigue. 
The guesthouse, designed as a self-contained bachelor pad for the couple’s three sons, features a façade of hollow blocks—forming a porous veil that offers both privacy and texture, blurring the threshold between outside and in.`,

Architecturally distinctive, the design draws inspiration from the interlocking forms of Tetris, creating a dynamic façade and split-level interiors. This playful configuration allows for double-height living areas and elevated bedrooms, enhancing both the spatial experience and natural light throughout each unit.
With expansive glazing framing uninterrupted views of the Mediterranean, the main living spaces and master bedrooms are oriented to capture the full beauty of Larnaca’s seafront—delivering a refined and immersive seaside lifestyle.`,

By shifting and aligning with the grid, the balconies carve out voids within the façade, set against the sleek glass walls of the interiors. This interplay generates a dynamic, diagonal rhythm across the building.

The façade comes alive with a rhythmic play of shifting balconies, each one uniquely positioned to enhance views and privacy. These outdoor extensions are more than functional; they reinterpret the landscape by integrating lush flower beds and sculptural planters, each featuring a tree dedicated to its respective apartment. The result is a vertical garden that softens the building's form while reinforcing its strong connection to the natural surroundings.`,

The site’s dual orientation—facing both north and south—posed the challenge of balancing privacy with openness. The design responds by introducing light, air, and greenery at every turn, creating a home that feels both secluded and connected to its surroundings.
Spread across two levels, the ground floor hosts the living areas, where the interior merges with a central garden, two courtyards, and a pool that extends the living space outdoors. The clients’ vision of a house immersed in nature comes alive here, with greenery framing daily life. Framed by the lush garden, the boundaries between inside and outside are blurred, creating a home that flows effortlessly with nature. On the upper floor, bedrooms are flooded with natural light and oriented toward tranquil views of the gardens and courtyards.

The house is composed of two volumes: the taller 4.3-meter-high living space gradually slopes down to the more intimate 3-meter-high sleeping quarters. At their intersection, a continuous band of windows introduces soft, indirect light and ensures natural cross-ventilation, reinforcing the home’s harmony with its environment.
The interior material selection of the house is also of nature by using real travertino marble for the living space, terrazzo bathrooms, and parquet floors.`,

The key feature of the project was rethinking the conventional separation walls between units and their balconies. Instead of flat dividers, Pearl House 5 introduces curved, concave separation walls and flowing balconies that define the identity of the building. These walls extend beyond the façade, forming sculptural extrusions along each floor and creating a sense of movement and rhythm across the elevation.
Located in a quiet residential area of Larnaca, Pearl House 5 distinguishes itself from its surroundings. The building has become a recognizable reference point in the neighborhood, affectionately known as “the curved building.”`,
